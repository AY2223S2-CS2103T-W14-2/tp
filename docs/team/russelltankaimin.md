### Project: EduMate

EduMate is a desktop address book application used to help NUS students maintain both their social and academic life by lowering the barriers to meet up and also make new friends within modules and school. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Basic User Profile**:
  * What it does: Personalise settings for the user of the application.
  * Justification: Gives a personalised touch to the user. Allows users to personalise their application's settings.
  * Highlights: Singleton class which inherits from Person

* **Overhaul of EduMate**:
  * Modified Json data to fit application requirements.
  * Split tags to Module and Group Tags
  * Allow User and Person to have Module, Group Tags and Telegram Handle.
