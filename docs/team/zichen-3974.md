### Project: eduMate

eduMate is a desktop app designed for NUS students to manage their academic and social lives by lowering the barriers to meet up and make new friends within modules and school. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
